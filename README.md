# Super-Resolution-CNN-basic-project
This repo contains a simple and basic project that uses a neural network to upscale the resolution of an input image. The model is full convolutional and It takes 1/1.15 minutes to train. For this project I decided to go with the dataset STL10, available from torch vision.dataset
